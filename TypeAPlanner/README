List of things app does:
-Lets user set whether they are a morning or a night person in settings (gets saved in user defaults)
-Able to add events to a list view as well as a calendar (if the user gives them access to a calendar)
-Able to send notifications through this app when each start time for each event occurs (if the user gives the app access to the phones notifications)
-When adding an event, if the rigor and importance level changes, then the start time will adjust (but the user can change it to whatever they want if they like)
-If event is updated, it will save updates and send new notifications and calendar events


** NOTE: If default calendar is google, yahoo, etc. adding to calendar will not work.
